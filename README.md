# IoT Practical Codes

1. Write a program to publish data (Light intensity using LDR) in Thing speak IoT cloud server. After that data subscribe from Thing speak IoT cloud server and control appliance (LED) using LDR and Node MCU.

2. Write a program to measure light intensity (using LDR), room temperature and humidity (using DHT11). Upload data in Thing speak IoT cloud server. After that data subscribe from Thing speak IoT cloud server. With the help of subscribed data, control LED1, LED2 and LED3.

3. Data publish (light intensity using LDR) in Ubidots IoT cloud server using HTTP protocol.
   Data publish (light intensity using LDR) in Ubidots IoT cloud server using MQTT protocol.

4. Light intensity measure and publish in Ubidots IoT cloud platform and subscribe from Ubidots IoT cloud platform using MQTT protocol.

5. Room temperature and humidity publish in Thing speak IoT cloud server (using Raspberry Pi).
